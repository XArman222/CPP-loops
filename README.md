## üéØ AIM
To learn how to use **for**, **while**, and **do while** loops in C++ for automating repetitive tasks, implementing algorithms, and improving program control flow.
## üìö THEORY
Loops allow a block of code to execute repeatedly, making them essential for:

* Automating repetitive operations
* Processing collections of data
* Implementing algorithms efficiently
* 
## üîÑ Types of Loops in C++
* **For Loop:** Best when the number of iterations is known. It combines initialization, condition, and increment in one line. Commonly used for counting or traversing arrays.
* **While Loop:** Ideal when the number of iterations depends on a condition that is evaluated before each cycle. Useful for waiting on input or dynamic conditions.
* **Do While Loop:** Executes the loop body at least once before checking the condition. Perfect for scenarios like menus or input validation where the code must run at least once.
* 
## üß≠ Loop Control Statements
* **break:** Immediately stops the loop when a specific condition is met.
* **continue:** Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one, helping simplify logic inside loops.
* 
## üîÅ Nested Loops
Loops placed inside other loops, used for generating patterns, working with multi-dimensional arrays, or creating complex output structures

## üß† Common Loop Algorithms

* **Factorial Calculation:** Multiplying numbers from 1 to *n*.
* **Fibonacci Sequence:** Each term is the sum of the two preceding ones.
* **Prime Number Check:** Verifies if a number has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
* **Sum of Natural Numbers:** Adds numbers sequentially from 1 to *n*.
* **Pattern Generation:** Prints shapes or tables using nested loops.
* 
## ‚öôÔ∏è Loop Optimization Tips

* Keep loop bodies simple and avoid unnecessary calculations.
* Use efficient and easy-to-evaluate conditions.
* Minimize memory access inside loops by caching values.
* Avoid deep nesting to reduce complexity.
* Use `break` to exit loops early when possible.

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION
Loops are fundamental in C++ programming for managing repetition and control flow. Understanding when and how to use `for`, `while`, and `do while` loops, along with control statements and optimization, is key to writing clear, efficient, and maintainable code.
